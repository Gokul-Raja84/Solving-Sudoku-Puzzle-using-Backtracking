This Python program solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It takes an incomplete Sudoku board as input, recursively fills in empty cells with valid digits, and outputs the solved Sudoku board.



* This Python program solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It represents the Sudoku board as a 2D list of numbers, with 0 representing empty cells. The main function solve(bo) recursively solves the puzzle by finding an empty cell, attempting to fill it with a number from 1 to 9, and checking if the placement is valid according to the Sudoku rules.

* If a number is valid, it is placed in the cell and the function is called recursively on the updated board. If a solution is found, True is returned, and if no solution is found, False is returned.

* The program also includes helper functions such as valid(bo, num, pos) to check if a number placement is valid in a certain position, print_board(bo) to print the Sudoku board in a readable format, and find_empty(bo) to find the next empty cell in the board.

* The initial Sudoku board is provided at the beginning of the program, and after solving the puzzle using the solve() function, the final solution is printed using print_board() to display the solved Sudoku board.   





Backtracking Algorithm:

<> Start with an incomplete Sudoku board.

<> Find an empty cell on the board.

<> Try placing the digits 1-9 in that cell.

<> Check if the digit is valid in the current position according to Sudoku rules.

a. If the digit is valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat steps 3-4.

b. If the digit is not valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next digit.

<> Repeat steps 2-4 until a solution is found (the board is full) or all possibilities have been exhausted.

<> If a solution is found, the Sudoku puzzle is solved according to the algorithm.




By following this algorithm, we iteratively explore all possible digit placements and backtrack when we encounter an invalid placement. This approach guarantees finding a solution for solvable Sudoku puzzles.
